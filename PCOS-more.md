# **Open-Source AI for Personalized Healthcare & Nutrition**

## **Overview**
This project is an **open-source, AI-powered dietary and health management platform** that provides **disease-specific meal planning, food analysis, and health tracking**. It is built to assist individuals managing conditions such as **diabetes, PCOS, heart disease, kidney disorders, and other diet-dependent health issues**.

This platform is designed to be **fully decentralized, privacy-focused, and accessible to everyone** using only **open-source tools and libraries**.

## **Problems Being Solved**

### **1. Lack of Personalized Dietary Guidance**
- Many individuals struggle to find **personalized diet plans** suited to their medical conditions.
- Existing solutions provide **generic meal recommendations** without accounting for **preferences, allergies, or cultural food choices**.

### **2. High Cost & Data Privacy Issues**
- Most dietary and health tracking apps are **subscription-based or collect user data**.
- There is a lack of **privacy-respecting, open-source alternatives**.

### **3. Food Label Complexity**
- People with dietary restrictions often **struggle to interpret food labels**.
- The project provides **barcode scanning & ingredient analysis** for better food decision-making.

### **4. Health Monitoring Without Cloud Data Collection**
- Commercial apps **store user health data centrally**, posing privacy risks.
- This platform ensures **all AI processing happens locally on the userâ€™s device**.

### **5. Open-Source Alternative to Proprietary AI Nutrition Apps**
- Most AI-driven health apps use **proprietary algorithms**.
- Our approach is fully **transparent and community-driven**.

## **Solution Overview**

- **AI-driven personalized meal plans** tailored to various health conditions.
- **Food recognition & barcode scanning** to analyze nutritional impact.
- **Health tracking system** that detects patterns in diet and symptoms.
- **Open-source and self-hostable** with complete data privacy.
